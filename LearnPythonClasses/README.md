    The main file for your project file should be call StudentManagement.py. This is where
            you will write your general program structures and call other classes from. It will be the
            main prompt. All of your logic code should be in a main() method.
            Your task is to design and implement a program in Python that supports recording of
            student information while enrolling a new student. You should base your data
            collection on the existing manual form. The system designed by you will be used by a
            student to enter their details via a text user interface, and this information will be saved
            in a structured, distributable text file called StudentRecords.txt . Your code should
            be able to append to an existing file or create one if the file doesn’t already exist.
            Each students record should fill a single line in the file. The students record should
            follow the below format in the text file:
            fodselsNummer,firstName,lastName,age,email,programmingCourse
            An example of this format and data is included in the provided text file
            StudentRecords.txt .
            To create and store the student you should implement a Student class called
            StudentRecordClass . The StudentRecordClass should be able to store the
            following information:
            • fodselsNummer
            • firstName
            • lastName
            • age
            • email
            • programmingCourse

It should also have a function called DisplayName(). The DisplayName function
should print the students full name i.e. First Name (Peter) Last name (Pan) should
print out: Peter Pan.

The StudentRecordClass class should be saved in its own .py file.


     create: Python class from StudentClass.py 
     Have Python3.7 installed
     Run the code with the folling statement:
     
      python3.7 SudentClass.py
      
     get the result:
     
          Nick Pann
